            "body": "<p> UPDATE </p><p> Bond is back - and on the PlayStation. At a recent EA gamer's day, we got an up-close-and-personal look at the 3D action-adventure being developed by MGM Interactive and Black Ops. Loosely based on the movie, Tomorrow Never Dies follows Bond as he battles evil media overlord Elliot Carver, who is determined to cause a war between the Chinese and the Brits - he's trying to trick each nation into thinking that the other is about to attack. Your job - as Bond - is to stop him, using all the weapons in your arsenal.Weapons and gadgets are obviously a major part of any Bond game, and you'll have a number of them - cufflink detonators, laser designators, thumbprint scanners, tiny tracking devices, ski-pole rocket launchers, satellite link-up cameras, and a mysterious cell device, among others. Plus, you'll also have a sniper rifle (the view changes to a sniper mode when you use it), infrared goggles, and cameras that actually work. Weapons include toys like grenade launchers and proximity mines - there will be 12 to 16 total weapons by the time the game is done. The game pauses while you change weapons, so you'll suffer no penalty if you suddenly decide to kill an enemy with a rocket launcher instead of the sniper rifle. Additionally, there is an optional ghost mode when you're in battle so that you can better target your enemies - without your back blocking the view. But you won't be alone in your quest to save the world. Wai Lin, the Chinese agent who partnered with Bond in the movie will be back in the game, also fighting Carver. You'll have a chance to play as both spies as the game progresses, although you only get to play Wai Lin in one level. Between 60 and 75 percent of the levels are based on things that actually happened in the movie; the rest are things that fit within the Bond universe, though they weren't in the big screen version. A good example is the skiing segment - never happened in the movie, but it looks great on the PlayStation, and it was one of the things the developers really wanted to put in - a Bond battle on ski slopes is just so classic Bond, and as one developer put it, \"You want to see him doing Bond things.\" As a result, the game is in third person - so that you can actually see Bond and all his various vehicles. Sneaking around is definitely a part of this game - you can sneak up to an enemy and pistol whip him. Stealth wall sneaking is another of the features developers are pleased with - along with the ability to duck and roll and dive and fire. And there are a number of missions where ducking and not getting caught are key - after all, Bond is only one man, and he is taking on the many minions of an evil empire.Speaking of missions, there will be more than ten of them: military outpost, Hotel Atlantic, arms bazaar, Carver media center, ski ridge, and stealth boat in Ha Long Bay are a few of them. Within the missions are a number of scenes, which transition quickly and easily into each other - so you'll move from inside to outside, from foot to vehicle, and so on, fairly deftly and without a lot of waiting time. </p><p> Plans for the game include a multiplayer mode, which is still being tinkered with right now. The two-player head-to-head matchup mode would have Bond vs. Wai Lin, or some of the other characters from the movie - you'll be able to play with either a vertically or horizontally split-screen. Also, Black Ops is hoping to get official MGM voice-alikes to do the voice work for the game, but nothing has been confirmed yet.And for those die-hard fans of the movie, there are a number of cutscenes taken directly from the film. Additionally, the opening credits of the game play out exactly the way they do in Bond movies, with shadowy female forms, guns, and the theme song; it drops you immediately into a Bond mood and sets the stage for super-secret spy gameplay extremely well. And gameplay is the key to any game. You can't look at Tomorrow Never Dies without thinking of and comparing it to GoldenEye 007 on the N64, but that's OK, because at this modestly mid-range stage in development, the game is holding its own, despite some control and camera issues Black Ops hopes to iron out in the next few months before the release. The game starts off with a simple level that basically involves learning the controls, maneuvering around environmental objects, and practicing targeting on some really simple enemies. The control - in terms of how your character \"feels\" in the environment - is not too shabby. You have the standard rolls (dodges), strafes, sneaks, and running-around moves that are pretty smooth and easy to pull off if you're in a space that's free of obstructions. Getting Bond to move around objects and go up stairs, however, could still use some work. We did get stuck several times on barrels and basically had to turn around and realign ourselves in a new direction to clear various objects - a function Black Ops says it is still tweaking.Angling Bond in front of an enemy with or without sniping is pretty simple and responsive. The accuracy is a little rough at this point, as the enemies drop pretty quickly if you shoot in their close vicinity, and Bond automatically and blindly seems to stop on his target (with no help from visual indicators such as lock-on targeting). But oddly enough, close-range shooting isn't always as successful as it should be. Again, Black Ops is aware of the targeting problems and plans to work those details out. Also, another feature is the ghosting function on your character. When Bond is attacking someone at close range, you have a default option lets him \"ghost out\" or become invisible so you can see the target directly in front of you. This can be disappointing if you'd actually like to see Bond attacking the enemy; however, developers did say they're considering making it possible during certain attacks for Bond to stay intact just for a second, even with ghosting turned on, so you don't miss the good stuff.Unfortunately, we didn't get a chance to try out any of the vehicles or skis and such, but we did see them in action, and without getting our hands on the controls at that point, it looked pretty fun. Scrolling through weapons and managing ammo, guns, grenades, health, and mission objects seems intuitive and comfortable. If Black Ops can get the cameras (which are intelligent, with several close-up/distance views available) and collision figured out, this may very well end up being a game to take pretty seriously.Tomorrow Never Dies won't be out till this fall, but we'll be sure to update you as the game progresses this summer. In the meantime, check out the new screenshots. </p><p> ORIGINAL PREVIEW </p><p> Favorite Bond moments - everybody has one. During his 35-year film history, Her Majesty's Secret Service's most renowned agent literally has traveled to the moon and back, cheating death countless times while meeting an outlandish cast of hit men, megalomaniacs, and, of course, exotic women. Yet it is specific action sequences, such as Roger Moore skiing off a cliff and parachuting to safety in The Spy Who Loved Me, that stand out most in moviegoers' minds. So when MGM Interactive began considering what kind of game it wanted Tomorrow Never Dies to be, it knew a simple retelling of the film's events - no matter how spectacular they may be - would never do. \"What we really wanted to do,\" says MGM Interactive's Michael Guttentag, \"was create a game that felt like a James Bond film. And what does it mean to be in a James Bond film? It's not like you think of one film, even though there are certain favorites. What you realize is [it's] the greatest moments from all the different films that really get you excited. So our concept was to create a game that brought you all these different great moments.\" Having made this decision, deciding to pair with developer Black Ops, which already has a number of excellent flight and underwater game engines under its belt, was purely academic. As Guttentag elaborates, \"We've known Black Ops for years. We've seen not only the quality of the games they've done, but also the dramatic evolution [between each successive] generation of their games. So we really think they have the right foundation to deliver the next level of action-adventure on the PlayStation. Plus, they're only three blocks away from us,\" Guttentag adds with a chuckle. So will Black Ops reheat what it has created in the past and serve it up to hungry Bond fans as a new game? Definitely not, says John Botti, the president and CEO of Black Ops. \"[The previous games] are serving more as starting points. There's a small percentage of Tomorrow Never Dies - less than 30 percent - which utilizes existing technology. We [at Black Ops] have always tried to one-up [ourselves]. So, we weren't comfortable with just going with the existing technology; that's not something that's sufficient, something that's going to fly.\" Speaking of flying, Bond will be doing just that in Tomorrow Never Dies, along with driving, skiing, scuba diving, and fighting enemies on foot GoldenEye-style. The game's story, surprisingly, begins where Tomorrow Never Dies ends. Why such an unorthodox move? \"Part of the fun of a James Bond film is discovery,\" explains Guttentag.\" So, we wanted to have a story that [required the player] to slowly piece together what was going on, figure out who the mastermind was, and then go save the world.\" </p><p> In order to do so, you must pay attention to what the game's characters say and do, rather than simply mowing them down. Guttentag elaborates, \"There will be non-player characters talking and moving around. You can sneak up around the corner and overhear the bad guy telling his master plan to everybody. That will be part of how you figure out what's going to happen and where to go.\" </p><p> By staying true to the license rather than slapping the Bond name on a side-scrolling shoot-em-up, MGM Interactive hopes to avoid the pitfalls that have trapped previous movie-to-game translations. \"We're not approaching this as just another licensing extension,\" assures Guttentag. \"We want this game to stand on its own.\" </p>",

            "body": "<p> <br/> D2 was originally going to launch with the Dreamcast, but delays prevented it. Currently, the game is slated for release during the third quarter of 1999 in Japan, and around the holidays here in the States.<br/> <br/> Up until now, a true impression of Warp's epic, D2, was not possible unless you bought Real Sound 2 as an import, which featured the D2 Shock demo. But at Sega's E3 booth, the D2 Shock demo was in place, offering a glimpse of what Eno-san has in mind. Different displays offered the various \"challenges\" found in the demo. One minigame showcased the first-person shooter mode that Laura (the main character) enters whenever she encounters the enemy. The other demo let gamers ride the snowmobile around the vast white fields of snow in the mountain range where D2 takes place. Lastly, another kiosk played the opening movie that has been featured in numerous articles surrounding D2.<br/> <br/> The movie's setting is a snowy mountain area. There is one figure in the snow, walking toward some unknown goal. The figure is hunched over, as if injured. Soon, it becomes obvious that drops of blood are being left along the trail. But oddly enough, the red blood turns green....<br/> <br/> Suddenly, we see the interior of a wooden cabin. The cabin is warmed by a fireplace. There is a rocking chair in the room. A woman - Kimberly - sits in the chair. She is looking at a blond woman in a bed. The blond in the bed is the story's protagonist, Laura.<br/> <br/> Laura is sleeping, but she is obviously tormented by a nightmare.<br/> <br/> Then we find ourselves looking into a star-studded galaxy. In the middle of the galaxy a small light is moving toward us. It turns out that the light is a huge meteor, and it is moving straight toward Earth. When the meteor hits the atmosphere, some strange glow rises from Earth and surrounds it. The meteor is consumed by the glow and begins to disintegrate. A small piece of the meteor manages to break free and enter Earth's atmosphere.<br/> <br/> Then we see a computer screen. It turns out to be Laura's laptop we are looking at. She is on an airplane, and she is typing into a journal. It says:<br/> <br/> Date: December 25, 1998Location: Over the New Zealanddddddddddddddd<br/> <br/> She has fallen asleep. Suddenly, the computer beeps and wakes Laura. Surprised by the sound, she drops various items from her tray table. She is irritated and begins to wipe up spilled orange juice from her skirt. A little girl named Jannie smiles and looks at Laura. A man named David, sitting across the aisle from Laura, picks up her powder compact. We see an inscription that reads: To LAURA, from your mother.<br/> <br/> At the same time, we notice a man wearing a hooded garment. He is reciting some sort of charm: Old Wise Man Shadow, Old Wise Man Shadow. A crystal ball on his knee glows red.<br/> <br/> And then two male passengers stand up, pull out guns, and open fire. They shout, \"Shut up, you people! Soon the Old Wise Man Shadow will show up.\" The passengers are struck with terror.<br/> <br/> After several gunshots and fatalities, Laura's compact starts to glow in an unnatural way. David opens it and sees in its mirror the small piece of meteor coming toward the airplane.<br/> <br/> David stands up, quickly takes Laura's hand and runs. The airplane is struck by a meteor. It crashes into a snowy mountain.<br/> <br/> Back to Laura - waking up in the bed in the lodge. We know now she is tortured by the nightmare of the crash. Kimberly stands up and walks toward Laura. At that moment, someone breaks into the lodge. It is one of the men who opened fire in the airplane in Laura's dream.<br/> <br/> Kimberly picks up a shotgun and aims at him. But the man suddenly produces some sort of weird material from within his body. It looks like vines and leaves. It is as if a plant had burst out from his body. Kimberly shoots at the material several times, but it doesn't die.<br/> <br/> The movie ends here.<br/> <br/> The gameplay in D2 is nicely varied over several mechanics: third-person adventure, first-person shooting, and... snowmobiling. The third-person sections are similar in style to Resident Evil. You move the character around in a 3D outdoor environment and investigate your surrounding. Alien/human hybrids will pop up out of the snow and attack, and then the perspective flips into a first-person target sighting until you wipe them all out. Another first-person moment occurred within the remnants of the crashed plane. A creature smashes itself back against a section of wall in the front of the plane, bursts a tentacle out of its midsection, picks you up, and proceeds to bash you against one wall and then the other. You have to fire at it repeatedly while being bounced around, which is no easy feat and a great variation on the standard fare. The snowmobiling part didn't really have a lot to it at this point. Perhaps if creatures were chasing you, it'd be a bit more engaging.<br/> <br/> The graphics in both the story scenes and gameplay for this game are fantastic. You have to hand it to Laura. All these crazy things keep happening to her (meteor hits plane, shape-changing aliens attack, and so on), and somehow her hair always stays perfect. </p>",

            "body": "<p> <br/> UPDATE<br/> <br/> We recently had a chance to play a near-final version of the game, and while all the single-player levels were available, we primarily focused on playing the multiplayer mode. So far, the four-player deathmatch is looking very good. There are many levels to choose from, each with its own look, feel, and array of weapons. For instance, the ice level Cool As Ice is full of freeze throwers and places all the players on skates. Meanwhile Fogging Hell is full of thick green fog and trip wires; a deadly combination for obvious reasons.<br/> <br/> Currently, no two-player cooperative missions exist and computer-controlled bots are not present (so the two-player deathmatch is essentially just tag), but GT confirmed that they will be in the final game, as well as 29 total Duke skins for the multiplayer modes.<br/> <br/> The single-player game appears much like a much prettier version of Duke Nukem: Time to Kill, meaning that there's a lot of climbing, jumping, and puzzle-solving, but mostly shooting. The game's sniper mode really comes in handy for picking off grenade-chucking enemies and is a great deal of fun to play around with.<br/> <br/> All in all, the game is looking promising. Some slowdown was seen in both the single and multiplayer parts of the game, but we're hoping that will be cleared up before the game's release.<br/> <br/> PREVIEW<br/> <br/> Even if you've seen the movies Evil Dead 2 and They Live a hundred times and know all his lines backwards and forwards, there's still a certain irresistible charm to 3D Realms' trash-talking Schwarzeneggarian hero, Duke Nukem. Publisher GT Interactive and developer n-Space apparently felt the same way because while 3D Realms was off working on Duke Nukem Forever for the PC, they created the first real console-only Duke title, Duke Nukem: Time to Kill. Recently released on the PlayStation, DN:TTK received fairly high marks, and now Eurocom (the folks responsible for Duke Nukem 64 and the home ports of Mortal Kombat 4) are taking a crack at the second console-only Duke game, the similarly themed Duke Nukem: Zero Hour.<br/> <br/> This title's premise revolves around another attempt by the aliens to travel in time and wipe out Duke's family tree, which obviously leaves Earth easy pickings. Duke must again defend his ancestors through a variety of time periods, such as the Old West (in mines, forts, jails, and the like), Victorian England (in castles, graveyards, and science labs), postapocalyptic New York City (the Statue of Liberty ruined? You crazy #!@#&amp;s!), and finally a mixed-up time zone where all of these eras merge... and the alien mothership resides.<br/> <br/> The gameplay should run much the same as in Duke Nukem: Time to Kill: third-person running, jumping, and shooting a la Tomb Raider - albeit with much, much more shooting. However, there will be differences to the game as well. For instance, Duke's puzzles will be a little more complex than just flipping switches: He'll have to collect objects such as crowbars and wire cutters to get the job done (sure, it's a little thing, but a little bit cooler than matching up colored key cards to doors, eh?). Also, beyond just traveling to different time periods, there are folks he'll actually have to save, some so that he can continue existing (just think what would happen if his mother was wiped out), while others will act as bonus characters. And, yes, he'll be freeing captive babes, as he finds them.<br/> <br/> On the graphical front, all the characters will be composed of polygonal models instead of the old Duke Nukem 3D sprites, and the game will feature colored fog, Gouraud shading, and all the other bells and whistles you've come to expect on the Nintendo 64 (possibly even boosted into high-res mode through the N64 RAM Pak). GT is also saying that this time out, both the third- and first-person perspectives will be available to you.<br/> <br/> On the enemy side, Duke will face some of his classic old Duke enemies such as the Pig Cops, Octabrains, and blood-crazy Sharks, and some new ones will be introduced, like poisonous snakes, flesh-starved apocalyptic cannibals, plague zombies, and other creatures. The main bad guy is said to be a heavily armed evil version of Duke himself, so you can expect a big fight there. And, speaking of weapons, the shotgun, submachine guns, pipe bombs, freeze-thrower, trip wires, and pulse cannon will be present to take on the baddies with, along with a rocket launcher that fires multiple missiles, Gatling gun, volt cannon, dynamite, and time vortex (an item-stripping bomb available only in multiplayer mode) too.<br/> <br/> Last but not least is the game's multiplayer mode, which is known to offer both cooperative and deathmatch levels for up to four players. The bot Dukes seen in Eurocom's Duke Nukem 64 will almost certainly make an appearance here as well, so one to three players competing in deathmatch mode should have a computer-controlled opponent or opponents to blow up while they track each other down.<br/> <br/> That's it! An intriguing package overall to be sure, made more so by the fact that the developers will hopefully have been able to learn from their previous efforts on the N64 and the n-Space Duke Raider game too. Expect more details on the game as we learn them, and the title itself in August of 1999. </p>",

But according to Climax Graphics' new game, Blue Stinger for the Dreamcast, what does happen in the year 2000 is an earthquake that creates a new island off the coast of Mexico.<br/> <br/> A year later, scientists are sent to investigate. What they uncover, however, is never exactly clear, as all the information and research mysteriously disappears. Some 17 years later, a top secret group called ESER (Especial Sea Rescue) is sent in to investigate. Elliott Ballade is the leader, Janine King is the brains - and the beauty - of the group, and Dogs Bowers is the demolition and weapons guy. Finally, they're also joined by Nefflim, about whom little is known, other than Nefflim's incorporeal and highly unusual looking.<br/> <br/> In any case, the game's filled with monsters to fight, cool guns to fight with, and any number of stunning environments to fight in. If you look at the screenshots, you'll see some gorgeous environments and graphics, things that we can only hope indicate that the Dreamcast will see better days - and more impressive games - than the Saturn ever did. Blue Stinger is slated for a November release in Japan and a likely 1999 release in the US - assuming it gets brought over here, as we expect it will.<br/> <br/> Climax Graphics is calling the game a \"real-time movie action-adventure,\" and, to that end, has hired Robert Short (who worked on Beetlejuice) to design the creatures and Peter Von Sholley (who worked on Mars Attacks!) to do storyboards. And if you want to see what it is that they're doing, check out this recently released movie of the game.<br/>  </p>",

            "body": "<p> <br/> The original Donkey Kong Country for the SNES was impressive because Rare was able to introduce pre-rendered graphics to a 16-bit system. In Donkey Kong 64, Rare is attempting to wow players with the size of the stages, the amount of animation, the number of characters, the number of textures on the screen, and real-time lighting effects. All of this adds up to the game needing to be 8MB, meaning it'll have to have the RAM pak to function. Since the pak's required, it will be bundled with the game, for a price said by a rep to be no higher than that of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time (US $59.99).<br/> <br/> Nintendo's Ken Lobb says the game has a little bit of Banjo-Kazooie and a little of Super Mario 64, but that it'll definitely be its own distinct animal. \"The way the levels are laid out, it comes off like a 3D platform game. There's some wandering, but there's a very obvious goal, and oftentimes, that means up! And it wouldn't be Donkey Kong if there weren't vines.\" And there are vines, as well as other DKC elements like mine cart rides, and new features such as a coconut-shooting gun.<br/> <br/> Each of the five characters (Donkey Kong, Diddy Kong, Tiny, Chunky, and Lanky) has different moves, such as the female character's spin/float. Once you open them up, you'll resume in the beginning of the game, but with stages that are distinctly different for each character, respectively. DK64's intro is a five-minute rap that spotlights the game's cast, and has to be seen to be believed.<br/> <br/> At E3, we got a chance to put our hands on the game and the verdict was universally good. The version of DK64 we saw is a small collection of levels from the game. Which character (there are five in all) you play as depends on which level you enter. The environments are graphically superior to those seen in Banjo-Kazooie, and seem either the same size or bigger. The real time lighting effects are also impressive, but the prettiest things about the game are the incredibly polished and smooth characters. When one turns to face the screen, it looks almost as nice as the characters in the film Toy Story.<br/> <br/> Playing the 3D barrel shooting stage (you aim by using a target in a first-person view) was fun, though about as easy as in the level within Donkey Kong Country. Meanwhile, the mine cart level was a blast and thankfully nowhere near as tough as the one in DKC. In it, you must collect 70 coins by leaning back and forth or jumping to snag them, while avoiding enemies in carts or other obstacles. You lose three coins every time you get hit. There are also switches in the track that you'll have to reach out and pull to open up sections of track that contain more coins.<br/> <br/> The toy factory level puts you in the shoes of the female monkey Lanky, and she can spin her pigtails, Bugs Bunny-style, to slow her descent. This level really plays like something out of Banjo-Kazooie, but of course, due to the use of the 4MB expansion pak and the cart's extremely large size, the graphics are quite a bit better. Gameplay is much the same as Banjo-Kazooie and Mario 64, complete with a butt-stomp, a back-flip, and various punches and kicks. You'll also be grabbing quite a few bananas throughout the game, replacing Mario 64's coins.<br/> <br/> Even with all the similarites to other titles, the feel of the levels is much more Donkey Kong then Mario or Banjo-Kazooie (that's Nintendo's company line on the game, but it seems to be true). We can't wait to get a chance to spend some real time with the game. </p>",

KK2000 for the PlayStation will have more than 50 boxers, but the N64 version will have only 25. You'll still have Muhammad Ali, Sugar Ray Leonard, Oscar de la Hoya, Joe Frazier, Roy Jones Jr., and Lennox Lewis.<br/> <br/> EA says there will be something called a flashstart option, which will let you jump into a fight very quickly, and a new great fights mode that lets you participate in classic fights. You'll also be able to create a fighter and train him. Unlike the original version, Knockout Kings 2000 will actually let you take an active part in your fighter's training. For instance, in the gym you will be able to spar and pound the heavy bag and speed bag, instead of just watching. \"Next year we're going to have more of a twitch method to [the speed bag and heavy bag],\" EA's Kirk Scott says. Plus you can expect new motion capture and punches in Knockout Kings 2. Also, the punches and the damage they cause should be even more accurate and true to real life, than they were in the first game.<br/> <br/> The game is scheduled for a fall release. As we learn more, we'll post it here.<br/>  </p>",

            "body": "<p> <br/> One of the big mysteries in Capcom's Resident Evil 2 was what happened to the cast from the original title, such as Chris Redfield, Barry Burton, and Jill Valentine. In RE3, you learn the answers. You play Jill, who enters the picture likely around the time the good citizens of Raccoon City start turning into zombies. Yes, that means the game's set before RE2, but it also takes place after it too. Confused? Let's explain.<br/> <br/> Having returned from Resident Evil's T-Virus incident at the mansion on the outskirts of town, Jill, Chris, and Barry found that no one on the force believed them. This was partly due to the fact that all the evidence was blown up when the house exploded and partly to the corrupt police chief being on the sinister Umbrella corporation's payroll. Frustrated, Chris set off for the Umbrella HQ in Europe to get to the bottom of the conspiracy. Meanwhile, Jill resigned from the S.T.A.R.S. force and was just about to leave town when G-Virus zombies and the other creatures of RE2 invade.<br/> <br/> That's where you come in, but that's just the start. Halfway through the game, Jill is rendered unconscious and, from there, you'll get to play as another character. Enter the tough as nails Brazilian mercenary Carlos Oliveira, who must get a cure and save Jill (let's just say she's \"sick\") so that she can continue on her quest. Once she regains consciousness, the time frame of the game is set 24 hours after the events in Resident Evil 2. As in RE2, decisions that you make during the earlier parts of the adventure will affect the events down the road. After playing the game a few times on the E3 showroom floor, we noticed a few different things happening at the same spot. This may mean that some of the events in the game are time-based.<br/> <br/> Resident Evil 3 Nemesis has ten different types of zombies carried over from Resident Evil and Resident Evil 2. Some have different clothing, and others look a little fleshier, as if they haven't been dead that long. Zombies are also not always wandering around when you come upon them. They may be slumped against a wall and \"wake up\" when you approach. They don't seem to grab at your feet immediately when they're shot to the ground, but they're currently taking many more bullets than before.<br/> <br/> You'll see a lot more of Raccoon City and visit some new areas as well. The first segment of the game takes place in the uptown area of Raccoon City, and Jill explores the streets and alleyways of the city and eventually the very police station where Leon and Claire began their tale of horror. In one part, Jill meets up with S.T.A.R.S. pilot and incidental RE character Brad Vickers who is seen being bitten by a zombie (he appeared as a hidden zombie in RE2, by the way). In the quick conversation that occurs before he flees, he mentions that something is hunting down STARS members. That something is the Nemesis, a seemingly unstoppable juggernaut similar to the Tyrant that plagued Claire in RE2, who is stalking about the city.<br/> <br/> Despite being set in a relatively small town, the map is surprisingly mazelike. Sealed barricades will rock from the masses of zombies behind them. Fire escapes, stairs, and twisting pathways give Nemesis a slightly greater feeling of freedom and break up the simple room-to-room progression of RE1 and RE2. You still bear witness to the door-opening simulations during loading times, though, but by the final version they are supposed to move quickly.<br/> <br/> The control in RE3 will be extremely familiar to veterans of the series, with very little having changed from Resident Evil 2. Drawing your gun to aim still forces you to hold your position, and while it seems a bit artificial after spending some time with Dino Crisis, there is the addition of autotargeting. This feature changes targets, should you be attacked from an unexpected angle. A Capcom representative says that a dodging feature of some sort will be implemented, although it wasn't present in the version playable on the E3 show floor. Rather than shifting to a floating camera and 3D world, Nemesis opts to stay with a fixed camera and prerendered locations. While the camera may not move and pan dynamically as in Dino Crisis, the cinematic views are intentionally used to limit your view and allows for some really nasty surprises.<br/> <br/> Resident Evil 3 Nemesis is expected to arrive for the PlayStation this November. </p>",
